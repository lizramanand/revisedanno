            <h1> Coffee Trucks vs. Cafes: A Battle Between the Auto and Real Estate Markets<h1>
            <h3>By: Liz Ramanand</h3>
<br>
<p>
Coffee is a necessity for most people, especially New Yorkers. While food trucks have been all the rage, specialty
coffee trucks and carts are the usual for busy caffeine addicts who need their fix on the go. What impact does this
have on the actual businesses as a whole and the markets they’re apart of?
</p>
<br>
<p>
Queens café Presso paid $21,000 a month for rent in Flushing but their monthly revenue was
about $45,000 a month with about nine employees to pay. Former manager of Presso Rodrigo Terco worked at the café two
out of the three years it was open. “People in this part of Queens like getting their coffee in a café, it’s more cozy,
there’s a lot of competition so perhaps that’s why they didn’t make enough to survive.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Terco goes on to say that location definitely matters when it comes to business. “The rent is much higher in Manhattan
so I can definitely see a coffee truck working in a busy area of the city.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
In 1981 Koch set a limit of 3,000 citywide permits for mobile food carts and trucks and a notable truck is Mud Coffee.
The coffee truck which started selling its own coffee blends out of a converted Con Ed step van usually around the
East Village in Manhattan. Parked not too far from the Astor Place Starbucks, the Mud Truck is known as somewhat of
an “anti-establishment” coffee company with their grassroots beginning and now has a café of their own.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The average startup costs for new coffeehouses range from $150,000 to $500,000 and a successful cafe's base profits
should equal roughly 10 to 18 percent of its sales. Mud Coffee is one of those successes in both the truck and cafe.
Yasmina Palumbo, publicist for Mud Coffee couldn’t speak of profits but she had this to say “in this day and age of
virtually no legal street parking available to food trucks, a brick and mortar business is far more profitable.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Estimated revenues from food and beverage trucks and carts is about $15 million in New York City. Costs for a coffee
truck could range anywhere from $40,000 all the way to $100,000.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Peter Morici, economist and Professor of International Business at the University of Maryland, talks about both the auto and real
estate business when it comes to coffee trucks versus stationed cafes. “Trucks from coffee truck sales doesn’t
heavily impact the auto industry too much but if the demand is there than it’s good for the auto industry. Anything
that prevents storefront business takes away from the real estate industry.”
